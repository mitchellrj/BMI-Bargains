BMI Bargains
============

This project was my first foray into the world of BFG. It was written in the space of 24 hours for the first ever Leeds Hack, one of the challenges for which was to make use of the BMI API.

This simple app takes your email address, budget, preferred destinations (among other criteria) and emails you when flights to any of those locations become available within your budget.
